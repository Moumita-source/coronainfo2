                <p class="q1">What is the FDA doing to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic?</p>

                <p> The FDA, along with other federal, state, and local agencies and public health officials across the country and internationally, plays a critical role in protecting public health during the COVID-19 pandemic. FDA staff are working around the clock to support development of  medical countermeasures and are providing regulatory advice, guidance, and technical assistance to advance the development and availability of vaccines, therapies, diagnostic tests and other medical devices for use diagnosing, treating, and preventing this novel virus. The FDA continues to monitor the human and animal food supply and take swift action on fraudulent COVID-19 products.</p>

                <p class="q1">How can I prevent covid-19?</p>

                <p> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wash your hands</li>
                        <li>Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face covering or non-surgical mask when around others.</li>
                        <li>Get the COVID-19 vaccine when it is offered to you.</li>
                        <li>Follow CDC guidance on large gatherings, social distancing and mask wearing, based on if you are fully vaccinated or not.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <p class="q1">Should I wear face-mask or not when going out in public?</p>

                <p>The FDA has authorized the emergency use of face masks, including cloth face coverings, that meet certain criteria for use as source control by the general public and health care personnel in accordance with CDC recommendations during the COVID-19 public health emergency. The FDA also regulates other medical devices, including personal protective equipment (PPE) such as surgical masks and N95 respirators. </p>

            <div class="question">
                <p class="q1">Where can I buy handsanitizer?</p>

                <p>  Many retail stores and pharmacies sell hand sanitizers. However, we understand that many stores may not have hand sanitizers available to buy. To help increase the availability of hand sanitizers, the FDA has issued guidance for the temporary preparation of alcohol-based hand sanitizers by some companies and pharmacies during the COVID-19 public health emergency. </p>
